# data file for loading information into dlib based object detector projects
# '#' are used for comments and will not be read in by the parser
# The file is organized in the following manner

#1 test data file: this is the file that contains the list of associated test data, text file format
# text file format: 0 -> grouped boxes (default), 1 -> open images bounding box format
D:/Projects/object_detection_data/FaceDetection/thermal_face_test_v1.txt, 0
#/home/owner/Projects/object_detection_data/FaceDetection/thermal_face_test_v1.txt, 0

#2 network: this tells the code which trained network file to load
D:/Projects/dlib_obj_det_run/nets/50918_0/nets/tfd_v02_30_30_100_HPC_final_net.dat
#/home/owner/Projects/dlib_obj_det_run/nets/50920_0/nets/tfd_v02_35_40_100_HPC_final_net.dat

#3 version name: this is used as the prepend to all files, must end with "_"
tfd_v02_

#4 root location where the results will be saved -> must have the following folders: nets, results, result_images
../results/tfd_v02/
